# I NEED PRACTICE!!!

## Goal
This GitHub repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering various Python concepts through practice and repetition.

## How?
To solidify my understanding, I will continuously recreate the concepts and problems covered in my bootcamp. Although this approach might seem repetitive and tedious, it's an effective way to reinforce my learning. If I find myself memorizing a problem, I will introduce variations to challenge myself further.

## Structure
This repository may not follow a strict structure. I will push completed problems here, possibly multiple times. For repeated problems, I will create a dedicated folder named after the problem, containing each iteration. Each file will include a summary of what I struggled with, what resources I consulted, and any other relevant notes. Initially, I might refer to the solutions for the first couple of attempts, but my goal is to rely increasingly on my own understanding and research. At the end of each iteration, I will compare my solution to the official one to identify areas for improvement.

## Additional Notes
- Each problem folder will have a README summarizing the iterations and learning outcomes.
- This repository is a personal learning tool and may not adhere to conventional project organization standards.
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I progress through my learning journey.
