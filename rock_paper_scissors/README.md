- **Challenges:** [I really didn't struggle with much in the first iteration of this. Probally because it was so simple.]
- **Resources Consulted:** [Becuase I didn't really struggle I came up with ideas of how to make it better. I looked up a way to make convert the choice such as "r" into "rock" more efficiently with less code.]
- **Notes:** [This problem was pretty straight forward so I'm going to go ahead to the next problem and will come back to this to follow up probally tomorrow or the next day if I feel I need to.]
