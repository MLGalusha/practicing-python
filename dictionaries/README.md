This folder contains multiple iterations of solving the "dictionaries" problem. The goal is to practice and improve my understanding of using dictionaries in Python.

## Iterations

### Iteration 1
**Date:** [06/17/2024]
- **Challenges:** [I didn't have any struggles with the actual problem itself, but I did struggle with adding addional content to the program]
- **Resources Consulted:** [I didn't need to look anything with the requirements up but I did look up more about dictionary manipulation and tried to implement more of that in this file.]
- **Notes:** [Once again this problem wasn't very hard for me, I might follow up on it some time later just to reinforce the concepts. In this problem I just tried to add as much as I could to it to make it harder for me.]
